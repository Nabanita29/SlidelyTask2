# Desktop App

HELLO :) I AM NABANITA CHATTERJEE AND THIS IS MY SUBMISSION FOR SLIDELY AI INTERNSHIP TASK! THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY!

## Description
As a part of task 2 what I have made is a Windows Desktop application developed in Visual Basic using Visual Studio. The application consists of forms for viewing and creating submissions with editable fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, GitHub repo link, and a stopwatch feature.

## Features
- **View Submissions**: Allows users to view previously submitted forms.
- **Create New Submission**: Allows users to create and submit new forms with editable fields.
- **Stopwatch**: A toggle button to start and pause the stopwatch without resetting.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implemented keyboard shortcuts for form navigation and submission:
  - `Ctrl + V` to view submissions
  - `Ctrl + N` to create a new submission
  - `Ctrl + S` to submit the form
  - `Ctrl + T` to toggle the stopwatch
